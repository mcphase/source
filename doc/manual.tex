\section{Introduction}

{\prg McPhase} is a program package designed to calculate 
properties of a magnetic system with localised magnetic moments
given the crystal field and/or the
exchange interaction constants.
For rare earth ions it is based on the standard model
of rare earth magnetism~\cite{jensen91-1}~\footnote{\em http://www.nbi.ku.dk/page40667.htm}.
The Hamiltonian of the standard model of rare earth magnetism 
is described in section~\ref{hamiltonian}.
Alternatively, a more complex Hamiltonian can be used which includes
all terms in intermediate coupling - this is important for transition metal
and actinide ions.

 

For each of the many tasks of the program package separate programs have been written.
Fig.~\ref{modules} gives an overview of the 
tasks of these different modules of the program package.

Structure of the program package showing the tasks of the different modules.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{description}
\item[so1ion(cfield):]
The best way to start with the program package is probably to get
acquainted with
the module {\prg so1ion\index{so1ion}}, which is the most important of several 
modules used for the calculation of single ion properties (see Section~\ref{cfield}).
\item[ic1ion:]
An advanced single ion module for intermediate coupling calcuations.
\item[mcphas:]
This module has been written to calculate the thermodynamic properties.
In order to  deal with the pair interactions a
 combined mean-field/monte-carlo algorithm is used in module {\prg mcphas}.
For a given temperature $T$ and magnetic field $\mbf H$ (vector)
 several possible magnetic structures are stabilised
by a mean field algorithm and the free energy is 
calculated. The initial values for this mean-field procedure are
modified by a Monte Carlo process.
See Section~\ref{runmcphas} on how to perform such a simulation.


The temperature and magnetic field is varied during the calculation
and thereby it is possible to map out the magnetic phase diagram.
The program produces a plot of the stabilised magnetic
structures and the magnetisation on screen, the
output files contain additional information 
such as calculated magnetoelastic and  neutron-diffraction
data. As a typical application of {\prg mcphas} the calculated magnetic
phase diagram of NdCu$_2$ is shown in fig.~\ref{ndphased}.
The exchange parameters required for the calculation of such a complex
antiferromagnet have
been determined from the dispersion of magnetic excitations
measured by neutron spectroscopy with moments aligned ferromagnetically
by an external magnetic field. Details are described elsewhere \cite{rotter00-29}.

\item[graphics:]
Several graphic programs easy the visualisation of the
calculated data (section~\ref{graphics}).

\item[mcdiff\index{mcdiff}:]
The module {\prg McDiff} can be used to calculate the magnetic neutrons
or resonant x-ray diffraction intensities. Note that neutron intensities
can be calculated going beyond the dipolar approximation for the magnetic
formfactor.

\item[mcdisp:]
An additional module {\prg McDisp} can be used to calculate the 
dispersion and intensity
 of magnetic excitations and diffuse magnetic scattering cross section.
  It is based on a mean field- random
phase approximation treatment of the problem (section~\ref{mcdisp}). 
\item[simannfit:]
In oder to enable the determination of the parameters of the
magnetic Hamiltonian from experimental data, a fitting module
{\prg Simannfit} can be used to fit experimental  magnetic structure and excitation
data. This module is based on the simulated annealing 
algorithm~\cite{kirkpatrick83-671} and described in section~\ref{simannfit}.

\section{Getting Started ...}  

First some important notes .... this manual does neither give an introduction into the theory of 
magnetism nor a description of the experimental techniques. In order
to use the program successfully, some basic knowledge of crystal field theory and the mean field
approximation is required, see for instance~\cite{jensen91-1}.
In order to compare the output of the calculation with experimental
data, it is recommended to be familiar with  experimental techniques used
in the investigation of magnetic properties
such as magnetisation, susceptibility, specific heat, magnetostriction
measurements and neutron scattering.

Using {\prg McPhase} for the first time, the reader should
\begin{itemize}
\item
rush into the program and test that it functions correctly on his system
by starting the demos ( type {\prg cd demo} and then run {\prg 01\_demo\_crystal\_fields.bat},{\prg %%@
02\_demo\_mcphas\_I\_NdCu2.bat}, etc.).  
\item 
learn about some special features and basic functions of the program package by
doing the tutorial in directory {\prg tutorial}
\item
look at the example calculations in directory {\prg examples}. These examples cover a large variety
of problems, which the program package may be applied to (see table~\ref{examples}). In addition, this directory
contains a large number of single ion property files which will be useful for setting
up numerical calculations for a specific system.
\item
with the help of this manual, which contains also some exercises the user is advised 
to learn about all details required to do a successful simulation of atomic magnetic properties
and set up calculations, which hopefully will be useful to interpret a large variety of 
experimental data.

\section{The Hamiltonian}
\label{hamiltonian}

\subsection{Rare Earth Ions}

The magnetic  Hamiltonian $\mathcal H$, which may be treated with
the program package is:

\begin{equation}
\label{hamilton}
 {\mathcal H}= \sum_{s,lm} B_l^m O_{lm}({\mbf J}^s) 
             -\frac{1}{2}  \sum_{ss'} {\mathcal J}(ss') {\mbf J}^s{\mbf J}^{s'}
	     - \sum_{s} g_{Js} \mu_B {\mbf J}^s {\mbf H} 
\end{equation}

The first term describes the crystal field (Stevens Operators $O_l^m$, see table in appendix~\ref{stevens}), the second %%@
the magnetic
exchange interaction, the third the Zeeman energy if an external magnetic field is applied.
Instead (or rather in addition) to this it is also possible to treat the 
more general two ion exchange coupling

\begin{equation}
\label{multipolehamilton}
 {\mathcal H}_{JJ}=
             -\frac{1}{2}  \sum_{ss'} \sum_ {ll'} \sum_{mm'}
	     {\mathcal K}_{ll'}^{mm'}(ss') O_{lm}({\mbf J}^s) O_{l'm'}({\mbf J}^s)
\end{equation}

For further information on the notation and symmetry restrictions to the
parameters in the Hamiltonian refer to~\cite{jensen91-1}~\footnote{\em http://www.nbi.ku.dk/page40667.htm}.

In addition to the above terms in the Hamiltonian the coupling of magnetic and lattice properties
is possible by introducing magnetoelastic interactions:
In order to calculate magnetoelastic effects the parameters $B_l^m$, ${\mathcal J}(ij)$ (or more general
the ${\mathcal K}_{ll'}^{mm'}(ij)$) are expanded in a Taylor expansion in the strain tensor
$\epsilon$ resulting in the magnetoelastic interaction (i.e. keeping only the terms linear
in $\epsilon$). The equilibrium strain can be 
calculated by considering in addition the elastic energy and minimising the total free energy.
The procedure is described in detail in~\cite{rotter02-8885}.


 


\vspace{1cm}

{\em Exercises:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Write down the list of nonzero crystal field parameters in the crystal field Hamiltonian
of a Nd$^{3+}$ ion in an orthorhombic crystal field (Section~\ref{cfield} describes how such a parameter set
enters a {\prg McPhase} calculation).
\item Taking a primitive orthorhombic lattice of Nd$^{3+}$ ions write down the most general
anisotropic bilinear interaction  for the nearest neighbour exchange interaction
(Section~\ref{mcphasj} describes how such a parameters set enters a {\prg McPhase calculation}).
\end{itemize}

%The $\tilde O_l^m$ in are the Racah  operators, which form a set of irreducible
%tensor operators.

\subsection{Intermediate Coupling}

For some rare earth ions and for transition metals or actinides it is necessary to
include more singleion ion states with differen L,S into the calculation. This
can be done in intermediate coupling using the module {\prg ic1ion}\index{ic1ion}, which
explicitely includes electrostatic and  spin orbit interactions for each ion:

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{ichamilton}
 {\mathcal H}&=& \sum_s \left \{ \sum_{i_s=1}^{N_s} \left [ \frac{p_{i_s}^2}{2m_e}-\frac{Z_s e^2}{|\mbf r_{i_s}-\mbf %%@
R_s|}\right ]
              + \sum_{i_s>j_s=1}^{N_s}\frac{e^2}{|\mbf r_{i_s}-\mbf r_{j_s}|} \right \} \nonumber \\
            &&  + \sum_s \xi_s \mbf L^s \mbf S^s  \nonumber\\
            && + \sum_{s,lm} L_l^m T_{lm}^s \nonumber\\
            && -\frac{1}{2}  \sum_{ss'} {\mathcal J_S}(ss') {\mbf S}^s{\mbf S}^{s'}
               -\frac{1}{2}  \sum_{ss'} {\mathcal J_L}(ss') {\mbf L}^s{\mbf L}^{s'} \nonumber\\
	    && - \sum_{s}  \mu_B (2\mbf S^s+\mbf L^s) {\mbf H} 
\end{eqnarray}

Here $N_s$,$Z_s$ and $\mbf R_s$ denote the number of electrons, the charge of the nucleus
and the position
 of the ion number $s$,respectively, for each electron being
$p$ the momentum, $m_e$ the mass, $e$ the charge and $\mbf r$ the location.
Spin orbit coupling, Zeman interaction and two ion interaction are written in terms of 
the (inverse) total spin $\mbf S_s$ and (inverse) total orbital momentum $\mbf L_s$
of ion number $s$. The crystal field in intermediat coupling is written
in terms of Wybourne parameters $L_l^m$ and Wybourne operators $T_{lm}^s$, operator equivalents
of spherical harmonic functions $\sqrt{4\pi/(2l+1)}\sum_i Y_{lm}(\Omega_{i_s})$ for the ion $s$.

\section{Solution of the exercises}

\begin{description}
\item[section~\ref{hamiltonian} {\em The Hamiltonian}] \ 
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item Fast and simple: take some book on crystal fields~\cite{hutchings64-227} and look up which parameters are nonzero 
 for the orthorhombic crystal field ($B_2^0$,$B_2^2$,$B_4^0$,$B_4^2$,$B_4^4$,$B_6^0$,$B_6^2$,$B_6^4$,$B_6^6$).

 Detailed Calculation: take the point group $D_2^h$, the Stevens Operators $O_l^m$ taken as a vector form
 a representation of this point group, which is reducible. Follow the procedure outlined in the book~\cite{elliott79-1}
 to split this representation into irreducible parts. The basis vectors of the unit representation may then be 
 linear combined with some arbitrary crystal field parameters to give the most general crystal field.
 Note that the basis vectors of the unit representation can be obtained efficiently by constructing the
 projection operator (eq. 4.51 in~\cite{elliott79-1})
  into the subspace transforming according to the irreducible unit representation. 
 \item Unfortunately no table is available for all relevant problems. Some cases are given in~\cite{morin90-1}.
 2 ways are possible to solve the problem. The accurate group theoretical approach which follows the calculation
 outlined above for the crystal field  and needs a lot of knowledge in group theory. However a more intuitive %%@
calculation
 can be made by writing down the most general two ion interaction and subsequent introduction of symmetry elements which
 will then give relation between parameters. As an example in the primitive orthorhombic lattice there are 2 nearest %%@
neighbours, which
 are equivalent. 

 In general the bilinear two ion interaction  has the form 
 $-\frac{1}{2}  \sum_{ij}  {\mbf J}_i^{alpha}{\mathcal J}_{\alpha\beta}(ij){\mbf J}_j^{\beta}$.
 $i$ and $j$ number the different positions of the magnetic ions in the lattice. Without loss of 
 generality the interaction constants ${\mathcal J}_{\alpha\beta}(ij)$ can be chosen such that
 ${\mathcal J}_{\alpha\beta}(ij)={\mathcal J}_{\beta\alpha}(ji)$ (because the expression is symmetric in
 angular momentum components any anisotropic part of the interaction tensor does not contribute to the
 interaction energy).  

 If $i$ and $j$ are nearest neighbours on a orthorhombic lattice, they are situated on one of the
 crystallographic axes, for example at [$\pm$100]. The off-diagonal components of the corresponding
 interaction tensor ${\mathcal J}_{\alpha\beta}(\pm100)$ vanish, because spin-configurations such as
 a moment (m00) on [000] and (0m0) on [100] must have the same magnetic energy as (m00) on [000] and
 (0-m0) on [100]. Furthermore the spin-configuration with (m00) on [000] and (m'00) on [100] must
 have the same magnetic energy as (m00) on [000] and (m'00) on [-100]. This and similar
 considerations lead to the conclusion that the interaction tensor must be the same for [-100] and
 [+100]. Therefore the most general form of the interaction ${\mathcal J}_{\alpha\beta}(\pm100)$
 is 
 \begin{equation}
 {\mathcal J}_{\alpha\beta}(\pm100)=\left(
 \begin{array}{ccc}
 {\mathcal J}_{aa}(\pm100) & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & {\mathcal J}_{bb}(\pm100) &  0 \\
 0 & 0 & {\mathcal J}_{cc}(\pm100) \\
 \end{array}
 \right)
 \end{equation}
 \end{enumerate}
\item[section~\ref{cfieldsep} {\em Using {\prg Cfield} separately}] \

 \item type: cfield -r -B

 \item In the crystallographic basis there are two ions.
 \item ... the simulation should run after typing {\prg mcphas}
 \end{enumerate}
\item[section~\ref{outputfiles} {\em output files}] \ 
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item at 2.8 Tesla
 \item (0.6 0 0), (2/3 0 0) and (0.625 0 0)
 \end{enumerate}
\item[section~\ref{mcdisp} {\em {\prg McDisp} - the calculation program for magnetic excitations}] \ \\
 the inspection of the file {\prg mcdisp.mf\index{mcdisp.mf}} shows that the calculation is performed at 3.2 Tesla field
 parallel to $b$, i.e. in the ferromagnetically aligned state. Due to the two ions in the crystallographic
 unit cell in general 2 modes are expected for each crystal field transition. After running {\prg mcdisp\index{mcdisp}}
 the results may be inspected in file {\prg ./results/mcdisp.qom}, graphically using the program {\prg disp}.
 It turns out the the soft mode (gap at (2/3\,1\,0) shows the largest intensity.
