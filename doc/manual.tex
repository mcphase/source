\end{itemize}

\subsection*{ ... in version 5.1 ...}
\begin{itemize}
\item parallel processing: the number of parallel threads can be chosen either in a system variable
MCPHASE\_NOFTHREADS , or setting in mcdisp.par and mcphas.ini nofthreads=2, or if nothing is 
specified the programs attempt to determine the available number of cores automatically
\item powdermagnon extended to nonortholattices 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{ ... in version 5.0 ...}
\begin{itemize}
\item programs mcdiff, mcdisp, ansitropy make use of parallel processing (compiled for 2 
        processor machines, if you want to recompile for more threads see install.txt) 
\item cluster module for calculation of clusters of ions and/or hyperfine interactions 
\item bfk program added (J Keller) - Becker-Fulde-Keller model for conduction electron interactions
\item singleion program extended to be able to read sipf files directly, cpsingleion to calculate specific
        heat, entropy etc.
\item perl parse option added to so1ion to be able to redefine operators $\hat I_{\alpha}$
\item resonant inelastic x-ray scattering cross section calculation possible with mcdisp option -x
\item the many programs  for displaying movies and densities (display\_spindensity, display\_chargedensities ...) are substituted by two programs: {\prg display\_density} and {\prg display\_densities}, which have options to enable all kind of graphics-movies-calculations.
\item mcdiff/mcdisp: new and more complete logic for taking various possible

\item mcphas.j:  {\prg cffilename} in mcphas.j replaced by {\prg sipffilename} !!
       removed gJ from mcphas.j input files (not read any more)
\item change of concept: in mcphas.mf, mcdisp.mf, mcdiff.in we store/input now the exchange      
        field and not the effective field ! Thus program singleion will be started by:
        singleion [option] T[K] Hexta[T] Hextb[T] Hextc[T] Hxc1Hxc2 Hxc3 ...   
         Hxcnofcomponents [meV] 
\item   a clear and complete distinction between interaction
         operators $\hat I_{\alpha}$ and observables $\hat \mathcal O$ is made. Therefore the
         user programmed c-module functions had to be redefined - thus loadable modules     
         programmed by users, which conforming to the old module function
         names (such as dmcalc du1calc etc ...) and definitions will not work in mcphas 5.0.   
          e. g. external module function {\prg mcalc} is replaced by {\prg Icalc} (interaction 
        operators) and  
        { \prg mcalc} (magnetic moment).
\item in output of mcphas:  *.hkl files are created using mcalc function of sipf module
        (i.e. they are based on the observable magnetic moment)
\item some bugs removed: spin/density animations of osciallations, icf1ion, threading, rhoso1ion
        rotateBlm
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{... in version 4.9..}
\begin{itemize}

- maxnoftestspincf added to mcphas.ini
\item
- sumcol changed to write summing in data file
\item
- pointc creates results/pointc.out with contribution of individiual pointc to cef pars

           such as  {\prg factcol 3-1x15 2.3 file.dat}
\item
- two dimensional convolution {\prg convolute2d}and gaussian creation {\prg gauss2d}
\item
- bug in parallelized mcdisp remove,  mcdisp.qev only print out eigenvectors, if intensity is calculated 
\item
- {\prg delcomments} option -c introduced
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{... in version 4.8...}

- mcdiff output file neutron intensities in absolute units. lorentzf=0 option added (allows calculation without lorentzfactor, i.e. the used value for the calculation of the intensities is lorentzfactor=1.0)

- range got an option -u to undo range

- delcomments got an option -s to be able to specify what is the comment string starting a comment line

- mcphas.xyt output of phase index changed: the index referred in earlier versions to the structure list in the mcphas.phs file. There, similar structures have different indices. Now the program mcphas has been changed and the phase index is determined by comparing the stabilised structure with the structures in mcphas.tst inputfile and if one of these fits (is equivalent), then the index of this structure is stored. This gives a more clean phasediagram.

- bugs removed from script2html, average, getvalue, mcphaseexplorer, mcphas.j last line read


\subsection*{... in version 4.7...}

- some bugs corrected in quasielastic scattering beyond dipole approx 
  (not very likely to be of any relevance for practical applications)

- program display redesigned to be able to handle error bars and 
  different symbol size

- program {\prg anisotropy} added to be able to calculate anisotropy loops
  for single ion property files

- many column manipulation programs extended to be able to manipulate
  error columns containing errorbars for experimental data

- program {\prg script2html} allows to create html documentation from
  several scripts. This makes documentation of calculations easier

\section{Introduction}

{\prg McPhase} is a program package designed to calculate 
properties of a magnetic system with localised magnetic moments
given the crystal field and/or the
exchange interaction constants.
For rare earth ions it is based on the standard model
of rare earth magnetism~\cite{jensen91-1}.
The Hamiltonian of the standard model of rare earth magnetism 
is described in section~\ref{hamiltonian}.
Alternatively, a more complex Hamiltonian can be used which includes
all terms in intermediate coupling - this is important for transition metal
and actinide ions.

 

For each of the many tasks of the program package separate programs have been written.
Fig.~\ref{modules} gives an overview of the 
tasks of these different modules of the program package.


\begin{figure}[hb]\begin{center}
\includegraphics[angle=0,width=0.7\columnwidth]{figsrc/mcphas_modules.eps}
\caption{\label{modules}
Structure of the program package showing the tasks of the different modules.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{description}
\item[singleion:]
The best way to start with the program package is probably to get
acquainted with
the program {\prg singleion\index{singleion}}, which is the most important of several 
modules used for the calculation of single ion properties (see Section~\ref{cfield}).
\item[mcphas:]
This program has been written to calculate the thermodynamic properties.
In order to  deal with the pair interactions a
 combined mean-field/monte-carlo algorithm is used in module {\prg mcphas}.
For a given temperature $T$ and magnetic field $\mbf H$ (vector)
 several possible magnetic structures are stabilised
by a mean field algorithm and the free energy is 
calculated. The initial values for this mean-field procedure are
modified by a Monte Carlo process.
See Section~\ref{runmcphas} on how to perform such a simulation.


The temperature and magnetic field is varied during the calculation
and thereby it is possible to map out the magnetic phase diagram.
The program produces a plot of the stabilised magnetic
structures and the magnetisation on screen, the
output files contain additional information 
such as calculated magnetoelastic and  neutron-diffraction
data. As a typical application of {\prg mcphas} the calculated magnetic
phase diagram of NdCu$_2$ is shown in fig.~\ref{ndphased}.
The exchange parameters required for the calculation of such a complex
antiferromagnet have
been determined from the dispersion of magnetic excitations
measured by neutron spectroscopy with moments aligned ferromagnetically
by an external magnetic field. Details are described elsewhere \cite{rotter00-29}.

\item[graphics:]
Several graphic programs easy the visualisation of the
calculated data (section~\ref{graphics}).

\item[mcdiff\index{mcdiff}:]
The program {\prg McDiff} can be used to calculate the magnetic neutrons
or resonant x-ray diffraction intensities. Note that neutron intensities
can be calculated going beyond the dipolar approximation for the magnetic
formfactor.

\item[mcdisp:]
An additional program {\prg McDisp} can be used to calculate the 
dispersion and intensity
 of magnetic excitations and diffuse magnetic scattering cross section.
  It is based on a mean field- random
phase approximation treatment of the problem (section~\ref{mcdisp}). 
\item[simannfit:]
In oder to enable the determination of the parameters of the
magnetic Hamiltonian from experimental data, a fitting tool
{\prg Simannfit} can be used to fit experimental  magnetic structure and excitation
data. This tool is based on the simulated annealing 
algorithm~\cite{kirkpatrick83-671} and described in section~\ref{simannfit}.

\section{Getting Started ...}  

First some important notes .... this manual does neither give an introduction into the theory of 
magnetism nor a description of the experimental techniques. In order
to use the program successfully, some basic knowledge of crystal field theory and the mean field
approximation is required, see for instance~\cite{jensen91-1}.
In order to compare the output of the calculation with experimental
data, it is recommended to be familiar with  experimental techniques used
in the investigation of magnetic properties
such as magnetisation, susceptibility, specific heat, magnetostriction
measurements and neutron scattering.

Using {\prg McPhase} for the first time, the reader should
\begin{itemize}
\item
rush into the program and test that it functions correctly on his system
by starting the demos ( type {\prg cd demo} and then run {\prg 01\_demo\_crystal\_fields.bat},{\prg %%@
02\_demo\_mcphas\_I\_NdCu2.bat}, etc.).  
\item 
learn about some special features and basic functions of the program package by
doing the tutorial in directory {\prg tutorial}
\item
look at the example calculations in directory {\prg examples}. These examples cover a large variety
of problems, which the program package may be applied to (see table~\ref{examples}). In addition, this directory
contains a large number of single ion property files which will be useful for setting
up numerical calculations for a specific system.
\item
with the help of this manual, which contains also some exercises the user is advised 
to learn about all details required to do a successful simulation of atomic magnetic properties
and set up calculations, which hopefully will be useful to interpret a large variety of 
experimental data.

\section{The Hamiltonian}
\label{hamiltonian}

We assume a quantum mechanical system that can be described by the Hamiltonian
 \begin{equation}\label{hamilton}
 \hat \mathcal H=\sum_{n=1}^N \hat \mathcal H(n) -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n,n',\alpha,\beta}
 {\mathcal J}_{\alpha\beta}(\mbf R_{n'} - \mbf R_n) \hat \mathcal I_{\alpha}^n \hat \mathcal I_{\beta}^{n'}.
 \end{equation}
The first term $\hat \mathcal H(n)$ denotes the Hamiltonian of
 a subsystem $n$
(e.g.~an ion, or cluster of ions). The second term describes a bilinear interaction 
between different subsystems
through the operators $\hat \mathcal I_{\alpha}^n$, with $\alpha = 1,2,...,m$. The operators $\hat \mathcal H(n)$ and $\hat \mathcal I_{\alpha}^n$  act in the subspace $n$ of the Hilbert space, i.e. $[\hat \mathcal I_{\alpha}^n,\hat \mathcal I_{\alpha}^{n'}]=0$,
$[\hat \mathcal H(n),\hat \mathcal I_{\alpha}^{n'}]=0$ and $[\hat \mathcal H(n),\hat \mathcal H(n')]=0$
for $n \neq n'$\footnote{Note that these conditions are essential and put a  limit to the
applicability of the theory, for example in the case of charge transfer excitations from
one subsystem to the next.}.
For example, in the case of a Heisenberg
 exchange between magnetic ions we would identify the set of operators with
 $\alpha=1,2,3$ with the three components of the  spin: $\hat \mathcal I_1 \leftrightarrow \hat S_x, \hat \mathcal I_2 %%@
\leftrightarrow \hat S_y, \hat \mathcal I_3 \leftrightarrow \hat S_z$.
The beauty of the analysis which follows is that it can be applied to
almost any Hamiltonian of the form (\ref{hamilton}). The analysis
of complex magnetic systems can thus be attempted by starting from a simple
form such as the Heisenberg model and by introducing, step-by-step, more
complexity into the model. For example, anisotropy and interactions with extended range can be introduced by modifying ${\mathcal J}_{\alpha\beta}(\mbf R_n - \mbf R_{n'})$, higher order operators can be 
introduced  by extending the index range for $\alpha$, and a complex single-ion term $\hat \mathcal H(n)$ may be added. 
Another example for a Hamiltonian (\ref{hamilton})  is the problem of lattice dynamics, which can
 be treated in the framework of this
formalism by identifying the operators $\hat \mathcal I^n_{\alpha}$
 with the atomic displacements $u^{n}$. Here the index $\alpha$ is not necessary and
$n$ refers to both, the atomic position index and the spatial coordinate of the displacement,
  $n=(1,x),(1,y),(1,z),(2,x),(2,y),(2,z), ...$. Note that this can be done, because the three spatial components of the 
displacement operators commute with each other (in contrast to the components of the spin) and each displacement
component acts in its own subspace of the Hilbert space. The kinetic energy
will be part of the single ion term $ \hat \mathcal H(n)$. Allowing more complexity to the system,
both the spin and lattice degrees of freedom can be introduced and spin-phonon interactions can be
handled by the theory.

The main limitation of the approach is that it neglects fluctuations associated with phase 
transitions and quantum disorder. We are primarily concerned, therefore, with excitations 
associated with a  well-ordered ground state.

Two special forms of the Hamiltonian (\ref{hamilton}), which have been implemented
are given in the following. Some other forms are also available, by programming
a single ion module the user may treat any type single ion Hamiltonian $\hat \mathcal H(n)$.


\subsection{Rare Earth Ions}

A more specific example of is the following magnetic  Hamiltonian $\mathcal H$ for rare earth ions,
 which may be treated with the program package:

\begin{equation}
\label{hamiltonre}
 {\mathcal H}= \sum_{n,lm} B_l^m O_{lm}({\mbf J}^n) 
             -\frac{1}{2}  \sum_{nn'} {\mathcal J}(nn') {\mbf J}^n{\mbf J}^{n'}
	     - \sum_{n} g_{Jn} \mu_B {\mbf J}^n {\mbf H} 
\end{equation}

The first term describes the crystal field (Stevens Operators $O_l^m$, see table in appendix~\ref{stevens}), the second %%@
the magnetic
exchange interaction, the third the Zeeman energy if an external magnetic field is applied.
Instead (or rather in addition) to this it is also possible to treat the 
more general two ion exchange coupling

\begin{equation}
\label{multipolehamilton}
 {\mathcal H}_{JJ}=
             -\frac{1}{2}  \sum_{nn'} \sum_ {ll'} \sum_{mm'}
	     {\mathcal K}_{ll'}^{mm'}(nn') O_{lm}({\mbf J}^n) O_{l'm'}({\mbf J}^{n'})
\end{equation}

For further information on the notation and symmetry restrictions to the
parameters in the Hamiltonian refer to~\cite{jensen91-1}.

In addition to the above terms in the Hamiltonian the coupling of magnetic and lattice properties
is possible by introducing magnetoelastic interactions:
In order to calculate magnetoelastic effects the parameters $B_l^m$, ${\mathcal J}(ij)$ (or more general
the ${\mathcal K}_{ll'}^{mm'}(ij)$) are expanded in a Taylor expansion in the strain tensor
$\epsilon$ resulting in the magnetoelastic interaction (i.e. keeping only the terms linear
in $\epsilon$). The equilibrium strain can be 
calculated by considering in addition the elastic energy and minimising the total free energy.
The procedure is described in detail in~\cite{rotter02-8885}.


 


\vspace{1cm}

{\em Exercises:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Write down the list of nonzero crystal field parameters in the crystal field Hamiltonian
of a Nd$^{3+}$ ion in an orthorhombic crystal field (Section~\ref{cfield} describes how such a parameter set
enters a {\prg McPhase} calculation).
\item Taking a primitive orthorhombic lattice of Nd$^{3+}$ ions write down the most general
anisotropic bilinear interaction  for the nearest neighbour exchange interaction
(Section~\ref{mcphasj} describes how such a parameters set enters a {\prg McPhase calculation}).
\end{itemize}

%The $\tilde O_l^m$ in are the Racah  operators, which form a set of irreducible
%tensor operators.

\subsection{Intermediate Coupling}

For some rare earth ions and for transition metals or actinides it is necessary to
include more singleion ion states with differen L,S into the calculation. This
can be done in intermediate coupling using the module {\prg ic1ion}\index{ic1ion}, which
explicitely includes electrostatic and  spin orbit interactions for each ion:

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{ichamilton}
 {\mathcal H}&=& \sum_n \left \{ \sum_{i_n=1}^{\nu_n}
 \left [ \frac{p_{i_n}^2}{2m_e}
        -\frac{Z_n e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0|\mbf r_{i_n}-\mbf R_n|}
        +\zeta_n  \mbf l^{i_n} \cdot \mbf s^{i_n}
        + \sum_{lm} L_l^m(n) T_{lm}^n
\right ]
              + \sum_{i_n>j_n=1}^{\nu_n}\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0|\mbf r_{i_n}-\mbf r_{j_n}|} \right \} \nonumber \\
	    && - \sum_{n}  \mu_B (2\mbf S^n+\mbf L^n) {\mbf H}  \nonumber\\
            && -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{nn'} \left[ 
({\hat \mbf L}^n,{\hat \mbf S}^n )
\stackrel{=}{\mathcal J}(nn') 
\left ( \begin{array}{c} {\hat \mbf L}^{n'} \\
        {\hat \mbf S}^{n'} \end{array}
\right )
     + \sum_{kk'} \sum_{qq'}  \mathcal{K}_{kk'}^{qq'}(nn') \hat{T}_{kq}^n T_{k'q'}^{n'} \right]
\end{eqnarray}

Here $\nu_n$,$Z_n$ and $\mbf R_n$ denote the number of electrons, the charge of the nucleus
and the position
 of the ion number $n$,respectively, for each electron being
$p$ the momentum, $m_e$ the mass, $e$ the charge and $\mbf r$ the location.
Spin orbit coupling is written in terms of the orbital momentum $\mbf l$ and
spin $\mbf s$ of the individual electrons. The
 Zeman interaction and two ion interaction are written in terms of 
the (inverse) total spin $\mbf S_n$ and (inverse) total orbital momentum $\mbf L_n$
of ion number $n$. The crystal field in intermediate coupling is written
in terms of Wybourne parameters $L_l^m$ and Wybourne operators $T_{lm}^n$, operator equivalents
of real valued 
spherical harmonic functions 
$T_{l0}=\sqrt{4\pi/(2l+1)}\sum_iY_{l0}(\Omega_{i_n})$, 
$T_{l,\pm|m|}=\sqrt{4\pi/(2l+1)}\sum_i \sqrt{\pm1}[Y_{l,-|m|}(\Omega_{i_n})\pm (-1)^m Y_{l,|m|}(\Omega_{i_n})]$ for the ion $n$,

\section{Solution of the exercises}

\begin{description}
\item[section~\ref{hamiltonian} {\em The Hamiltonian}] \ 
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item Fast and simple: take some book on crystal fields~\cite{hutchings64-227} and look up which parameters are nonzero 
 for the orthorhombic crystal field ($B_2^0$,$B_2^2$,$B_4^0$,$B_4^2$,$B_4^4$,$B_6^0$,$B_6^2$,$B_6^4$,$B_6^6$).

 Detailed Calculation: take the point group $D_2^h$, the Stevens Operators $O_l^m$ taken as a vector form
 a representation of this point group, which is reducible. Follow the procedure outlined in the book~\cite{elliott79-1}
 to split this representation into irreducible parts. The basis vectors of the unit representation may then be 
 linear combined with some arbitrary crystal field parameters to give the most general crystal field.
 Note that the basis vectors of the unit representation can be obtained efficiently by constructing the
 projection operator (eq. 4.51 in~\cite{elliott79-1})
  into the subspace transforming according to the irreducible unit representation. 
 \item Unfortunately no table is available for all relevant problems. Some cases are given in~\cite{morin90-1}.
 2 ways are possible to solve the problem. The accurate group theoretical approach which follows the calculation
 outlined above for the crystal field  and needs a lot of knowledge in group theory. However a more intuitive %%@
calculation
 can be made by writing down the most general two ion interaction and subsequent introduction of symmetry elements which
 will then give relation between parameters. As an example in the primitive orthorhombic lattice there are 2 nearest %%@
neighbours, which
 are equivalent. 

 In general the bilinear two ion interaction  has the form 
 $-\frac{1}{2}  \sum_{ij}  {\mbf J}_i^{alpha}{\mathcal J}_{\alpha\beta}(ij){\mbf J}_j^{\beta}$.
 $i$ and $j$ number the different positions of the magnetic ions in the lattice. Without loss of 
 generality the interaction constants ${\mathcal J}_{\alpha\beta}(ij)$ can be chosen such that
 ${\mathcal J}_{\alpha\beta}(ij)={\mathcal J}_{\beta\alpha}(ji)$ (because the expression is symmetric in
 angular momentum components any anisotropic part of the interaction tensor does not contribute to the
 interaction energy).  

 If $i$ and $j$ are nearest neighbours on a orthorhombic lattice, they are situated on one of the
 crystallographic axes, for example at [$\pm$100]. The off-diagonal components of the corresponding
 interaction tensor ${\mathcal J}_{\alpha\beta}(\pm100)$ vanish, because spin-configurations such as
 a moment (m00) on [000] and (0m0) on [100] must have the same magnetic energy as (m00) on [000] and
 (0-m0) on [100]. Furthermore the spin-configuration with (m00) on [000] and (m'00) on [100] must
 have the same magnetic energy as (m00) on [000] and (m'00) on [-100]. This and similar
 considerations lead to the conclusion that the interaction tensor must be the same for [-100] and
 [+100]. Therefore the most general form of the interaction ${\mathcal J}_{\alpha\beta}(\pm100)$
 is 
 \begin{equation}
 {\mathcal J}_{\alpha\beta}(\pm100)=\left(
 \begin{array}{ccc}
 {\mathcal J}_{aa}(\pm100) & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & {\mathcal J}_{bb}(\pm100) &  0 \\
 0 & 0 & {\mathcal J}_{cc}(\pm100) \\
 \end{array}
 \right)
 \end{equation}
 \end{enumerate}
\item[section~\ref{cfieldsep} {\em Using {\prg so1ion} separately}] \ 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item type: so1ion -c -B m m Nd3+ 2 10 rk
 \item edit file bkq.parameter and enter the crystal field parameters given in section~\ref{cf1ion}
 \item type: so1ion -r -B
 \item edit file results/so1ion.output to see the result of the calculation
 \end{itemize}
\item[section~\ref{start} {\em starting a simulation}] \ 

 \begin{enumerate}
 \item In the crystallographic basis there are two ions.
 \item ... the simulation should run after typing {\prg mcphas}
 \end{enumerate}
\item[section~\ref{outputfiles} {\em output files}] \ 
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item at 2.8 Tesla
 \item (0.6 0 0), (2/3 0 0) and (0.625 0 0)
 \end{enumerate}
\item[section~\ref{mcdisp} {\em {\prg McDisp} - the calculation program for magnetic excitations}] \ \\
 the inspection of the file {\prg mcdisp.mf\index{mcdisp.mf}} shows that the calculation is performed at 3.2 Tesla field
 parallel to $b$, i.e. in the ferromagnetically aligned state. Due to the two ions in the crystallographic
 unit cell in general 2 modes are expected for each crystal field transition. After running {\prg mcdisp\index{mcdisp}}
 the results may be inspected in file {\prg ./results/mcdisp.qom}, graphically using the program {\prg disp}.
 It turns out the the soft mode (gap at (2/3\,1\,0) shows the largest intensity.
